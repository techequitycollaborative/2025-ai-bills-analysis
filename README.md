# California State AI Bills: 2025 Recap
We reviewed all the AI-related bills from the California legislature's 2025 session.

## Process

### Bill selection
Outside of this repository, we pulled all the bills from our [CA Legislation Tracker](https://github.com/techequitycollaborative/legislation-tracker) tool that had been categorized as an AI bill. We combined this list of bills with a previous list of AI bills that we had been tracking before the creation of the CA Legislation Tracker. We then manually reviewed this list to remove duplicates and verify for relevance. We removed bills that were not truly AI related but had been inaccurately labeled, as well as those that mentioned AI but did not contain substantive AI policies. This process resulted in 71 bills for analysis.

### Bill success
We then assign each bill a 'success status' based on their final bill status, as reported by California LegInfo. We assign the following success categories: 
- Signed: A bill was signed by the Governor and chaptered
- Vetoed: A bill made it to the Governor's desk but was vetoed
- Failed: A bill never made it to the Governor's desk

## Bill success overview
Of the 71 bills reviewed, 18 were signed, 7 were vetoed, and 46 failed to reach the Governor's desk.

## Bill success by topic
Some bills had more than one assigned topic, so the data here totals to move than 71.

## Failed bills status
Of the bills that failed to reach the Governor's desk, how far in the process did they go? At what stage were bills stalling?
