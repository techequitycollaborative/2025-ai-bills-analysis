The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an initiative measure approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA. Existing law, the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act, establishes privacy standards for the collection, use, and disclosure of information gathered in connection with insurance transactions by insurance institutions, agents, and insurance-support organizations.\n\nThis bill would enact the Insurance Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2025 to establish new standards for the collection, processing, retaining, or sharing of consumers' personal information by insurance licensees and their third-party service providers. The bill would authorize processing of a consumer's personal information for specified purposes, including in connection with an insurance transaction. The bill would require a licensee to provide a clear and conspicuous privacy notice that includes specified information to a consumer at specified times, and would prohibit the processing of a consumer's personal information unless it is consistent with and complies with that notice and is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes related to an insurance transaction or other purpose the consumer requested or authorized. The bill would also require a licensee to provide a privacy rights notice, as specified, to each consumer with whom the licensee has an ongoing business relationship. The bill would require a licensee or third-party service provider to obtain a consumer's consent to take specified actions, and would set forth the means by which consent is obtained. The bill would authorize a licensee to retain personal information, as specified, and would require a licensee to develop a written records retention policy and schedule. The bill would require a licensee to provide specified information to a consumer if it makes an adverse underwriting decision, and would provide a process by which a consumer may correct, amend, or delete any personal or publicly available information about the consumer in the possession of the licensee or its third-party service providers. The bill would require a contract between a licensee and a third-party service provider to clearly govern the processing of personal information performed on behalf of the licensee. The bill would prohibit retaliation against a consumer because the consumer exercised or attempted to exercise their rights under the act. The bill would prohibit public disclosure of specified systems, processes, policies, procedures, and plans that are disclosed to the Insurance Commissioner.\n\nTo determine if a licensee or third-party service provider has been or is engaged in any conduct in violation of the act, this bill would authorize the commissioner to examine and investigate the licensee or third-party service provider, then hold a hearing regarding those violations. If a hearing results in a finding of a knowing violation, the bill would require the commissioner to issue a cease and desist order and would authorize a penalty of at least $5,000, not to exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate for multiple violations. The bill would authorize additional fines and suspension or revocation of the licensee's license if a cease and desist order is violated. Under the bill, a person who knowingly and willfully obtains information about a consumer from a licensee or third-party service provider under false pretenses would be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $50,000, imprisonment in a county jail for up to 6 months, or both, thus creating a crime and imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","2025-02-12 >> Introduced.

The bill would require a data center facility to meet specified requirements in order to receive certification from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, including requirements relating to job creation, investment, and renewable energy procurement requirements.

The California AI Transparency Act requires a covered provider, as defined, of a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) system to offer the user the option to include a manifest disclosure in image, video, or audio content, or content that is any combination thereof, created or altered by the covered provider's GenAI system that, among other things, identifies content as AI-generated content.\n\nThis bill would establish a process by which the Attorney General designates, for a renewable period of 3 years, a private entity as a multistakeholder regulatory organization (MRO) if that entity meets certain requirements, including that the entity presents a plan that ensures acceptable mitigation of risk from any MRO-certified artificial intelligence models and artificial intelligence applications. The bill would require an applicant for designation by the Attorney General as an MRO to submit with its application a plan that contains certain elements, including the applicant's approach to mitigating specific high-impact risks, including cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, malign persuasion, and artificial intelligence model autonomy and exfiltration.

Existing law requires a data broker, in registering with the agency, to pay a registration fee in an amount determined by the agency and provide specified information, including, among other things, the name of the data broker and its primary physical, email, and internet website addresses, and whether the data broker collects the personal information of minors, consumers' precise geolocation, or consumers' reproductive health care data.\n\nThis bill would require a data broker to provide additional information to the agency, including whether the data broker collects consumers' names, dates of birth, ZIP Codes, email addresses, phone numbers, login or account information, various government identification numbers, mobile advertising, connected television, or vehicle identification numbers, citizenship data, union membership status, sexual orientation status, gender identity and gender expression data, biometric data, and up to 3, but no fewer than one, of the most common types of personal information that the data broker collects, as provided. The bill would also require a data broker to provide information regarding whether, in the past year, the data broker shared or sold consumers' data to a foreign actor, as defined, the federal government, other state governments, law enforcement, as provided, or a developer of a GenAI system, as defined. The bill would make changes to the administrative fines and costs that apply to data brokers who fail to register.\n\nExisting law requires, beginning January 1, 2026, the California Privacy Protection Agency to establish an accessible deletion mechanism that, among other things, allows a consumer, through a single verifiable consumer request, to request that every data broker that maintains any personal information delete any personal information related to that consumer held by the data broker or associated service provider or contractor. Existing law requires, beginning August 1, 2026, a data broker to access the accessible deletion mechanism at least once every 45 days and, among other things, process a denied request to delete personal information as an opt-out of the sale or sharing of the consumer's personal information under the CCPA, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require a data broker to process the above-described denied request within 45 days of receiving the request.\n\nExisting law requires the agency to create a page on its internet website where registration information provided by data brokers and the accessible deletion mechanism is accessible to the public.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the agency from making accessible to the public on its internet website information regarding whether the data broker collects consumers' names, dates of birth, zip codes, email addresses, phone numbers, mobile advertising, connected television, or vehicle identification numbers, and the most common types of personal information that it collects.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes and intent of the CPRA for specified reasons.","2025-02-13 >> Introduced.

Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or health insurer to use prior authorization and other utilization review or utilization management functions, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. Existing law requires a health care service plan or health insurer to file various reports with the relevant regulating department.\n\nThis bill would require a health care service plan or health insurer that imposes prior authorization to report specified prior authorization data from the previous calendar year on its internet website on or before February 1, 2026, for health care service plans, on or before February 1, 2028, for health insurers, and annually on or before February 1 thereafter. The bill would require a health care service plan or health insurer to annually report specified claims and prior authorization data to the relevant department by February 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2027, for health care service plans and February 1, 2028, for health insurers. The bill would require the departments to post this information, disaggregated by plan or insurer, on their internet websites by April 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2027, for health care service plans and April 15, 2028, for health insurers. The bill would authorize the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care and the Insurance Commissioner to reject a report required pursuant to these provisions, and would authorize the commissioner to assess an administrative penalty against a health insurer for a failure to correct a deficiency in the report. The bill would authorize the director and commissioner to make rules and regulations specifying the form and content of the reports posted online and submitted to the relevant department, as specified. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","2025-02-14 >> Read first time.

When a photograph or likeness of an employee of the person using the photograph or likeness appearing in an advertisement or other publication is incidental and not essential to the purpose of the publication, existing law establishes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence that failure to obtain the consent of an employee was not a knowing use of an employee's photograph or likeness. \n\nThis bill would clarify that, for purposes of this cause of action, a voice or likeness includes a digital replica, as defined. The bill would also remove the provisions establishing the rebuttable presumption when an employee's likeness or photograph appears in an advertisement or other publication.\n\n(3) Existing law governs the admissibility of evidence in court proceedings. Existing law prescribes procedures for the authentication of photographs and audio and video recordings.\n\nThis bill would require the Judicial Council, by no later than January 1, 2027, to review the impact of artificial intelligence on the admissibility of proffered evidence in court proceedings and develop any necessary rules of court to assist courts in assessing claims that proffered evidence has been generated by or manipulated by artificial intelligence and determining whether such evidence is admissible.\n\n(4) Existing law, the Unfair Competition Law, establishes a statutory cause of action for unfair competition, including any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, and establishes remedies and penalties in that regard, including civil penalties.\n\nThis bill would require, by December 1, 2026, and except as provided, any person or entity that makes available to consumers any artificial intelligence technology that enables a user to create a digital replica, as defined, to provide a consumer warning that unlawful use of the technology to depict another person without prior consent may result in civil or criminal liability for the user. The bill would require the warning to be hyperlinked on any page or screen where the consumer may input a prompt to the technology and included in the terms and conditions for use of the technology.

Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including pursuant to contracts with various types of managed care plans. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan, including a Medi-Cal managed care plan, or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or concurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires utilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan's or insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as specified.\n\nThis bill would change the timeline for prior or concurrent authorization requests to no more than 3 business days from the plan's or insurer's receipt via electronic submission, or 5 business days from receipt via submission that is not electronic, of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. The bill would require a utilization review decision to be made within 24 hours from receipt of a prior or concurrent authorization request via electronic submission, or 48 hours from receipt via submission that is not electronic, if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would exclude Medi-Cal managed care plans from the above-described timeline changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","2025-02-10 >> Read first time.

Existing law authorizes a ward who is permitted to reside in a county other than their county of legal residence to be supervised by the probation officer of the county of actual residence, with the consent of that probation officer.\n\nThis bill would clarify that these provisions apply to wards discharged to probation supervision after having been confined in a secure youth treatment facility, or after having been transferred to a less restrictive program from a secure youth treatment facility.\n\n(4) Existing law authorizes any county or court to implement a ""comprehensive collection program"" as a separate revenue collection activity, and requires the program to meet certain criteria, one of which is that the program engages in specified activities in collecting fines or penalties, including, among other things, initiating a driver's license suspension or hold, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete initiating suspensions or holds for driver's licenses from the list of activities in which the program may engage. \n\n(5) Various provisions of the Health and Safety Code, Penal Code, and Welfare and Institutions Code, among others, refer to training and other requirements related to ""deescalation techniques."" \n\nThis bill would revise all references to ""deescalation"" to ""de-escalation.""\n\n(6) The bill would also make other technical changes, both conforming and nonsubstantive.","2025-03-12 >> Introduced.

The TFAIA would also require a large frontier developer to transmit to the Office of Emergency Services a summary of any assessment of catastrophic risk, as defined, resulting from internal use of its frontier models, as specified. The TFAIA would require the Office of Emergency Services to establish a mechanism to be used by a frontier developer or a member of the public to report, as prescribed, a critical safety incident, as defined, and would also require the Office of Emergency Services to establish a mechanism to be used by a large frontier developer to confidentially submit summaries of any assessments of the potential for catastrophic risk resulting from internal use of its frontier models, as prescribed.\n\nThe TFAIA would exempt from the California Public Records Act a report of a critical safety incident submitted to the Office of Emergency Services, a report of assessments of catastrophic risk from internet use, and a covered employee report made pursuant to the whistleblower protections described below.\n\n The TFAIA would impose a civil penalty for noncompliance with the TFAIA to be enforced by the Attorney General, as prescribed.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the Department of Technology within the Government Operations Agency. Existing law requires the department to conduct, in coordination with other interagency bodies as it deems appropriate, a comprehensive inventory of all high-risk automated decision systems that have been proposed for use, development, or procurement by, or are being used, developed, or procured by, any state agency.\n\nThis bill would establish within the Government Operations Agency a consortium required to develop a framework for the creation of a public cloud computing cluster to be known as ""CalCompute"" that advances the development and deployment of artificial intelligence that is safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable by, among other things, fostering research and innovation that benefits the public, as prescribed. The bill would require the Government Operations Agency to, on or before January 1, 2027, submit a report from the consortium to the Legislature with that framework and would dissolve the consortium upon submission of that report. The bill would make those provisions operative only upon an appropriation in a budget act, or other measure, for its purposes.\n\n(3) Existing law prohibits employers and their agents from making, adopting, or enforcing a rule, regulation, or policy preventing an employee from disclosing information to certain entities or from providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a law, as specified, and prohibits retaliation against an employee for, among other things, exercising these rights.\n\nThis bill would, among other things related to protecting whistleblowers working with foundation models, prohibit a frontier developer from making, adopting, enforcing, or entering into a rule, regulation, policy, or contract that prevents a covered employee, as defined, from disclosing, or retaliates against a covered employee for disclosing, information to the Attorney General, a federal authority, a person with authority over the covered employee, or another covered employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the reported issue, if the covered employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses that the frontier developer's activities pose a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the frontier developer has violated the TFAIA.\n\n This bill would require a large frontier developer to provide a certain internal process through which a covered employee may anonymously disclose information to the large frontier developer if the covered employee believes in good faith that the information indicates that the large frontier developer's activities present a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the large frontier developer violated the TFAIA. The bill would specify provisions particular to the enforcement of those whistleblower protections and would authorize attorney's fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation.\n\nThis bill would preempt any rule, regulation, code, ordinance, or other law adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency on or after January 1, 2025, specifically related to the regulation of frontier developers with respect to their management of catastrophic risk.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","2025-01-07 >> Introduced.

Existing law requires a data broker to delete all personal information of the consumer at least once every 45 days unless the consumer requests otherwise, as prescribed.

Existing law, commonly known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts and prescribes provisions for its enforcement through civil actions.\n\nThis bill would enact the California Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act of 2025, to prohibit a person, as described, from distributing or making recommendations based on the use of a pricing algorithm to 2 or more competitors, as defined, under specified circumstances, if the person knows or should know that the pricing algorithm processes competitor data, as defined.\n\n This bill would also prohibit a person from using the recommendation of a pricing algorithm that processes competitor data, as specified, if the person knows or should know that the pricing algorithm uses or incorporates competitor data.

The bill would also prohibit an employer from using a workplace surveillance tool to infer specified categories of information about a worker, including, among others, their immigration status, veteran status, ancestral history, religious or political beliefs, disability status, criminal record, or credit history.

The act requires certain professionals, including specified health practitioners and social workers, known as ""mandated reporters,"" to report by telephone known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to a local law enforcement agency or a county welfare or probation department, as specified.

Existing law authorizes a county welfare agency to develop a program for internet-based reporting of child abuse and neglect, as specified. Existing law authorizes a mandated reporter in a county where the program is active to use the internet-based reporting tool in lieu of the required initial telephone report.

This bill would authorize the County of Los Angeles to establish a 2-year pilot program to test a new model for the mandatory reporting of child abuse or neglect. The bill would require the pilot program to include a comprehensive County of Los Angeles mandated reporter training that may be made available to all mandated reporters in the county. The bill would require the pilot program to also include the development and deployment of an internet-based decision-support tool, developed through a collaborative process with, among others, the State Department of Social Services, for mandated reporters who have completed that training. The bill would require the decision-support tool to, among other things, make a recommendation on whether or not to report and would prohibit the decision-support tool from using predictive analysis. The bill would, during the time the pilot program is in effect, deem a mandated reporter to have satisfied their reporting duties if the reporter completed the training, used the decision-support tool, and complied with the recommended action. The bill would shield a mandated reporter who satisfied their reporting duties pursuant to these provisions from civil liability or criminal penalty, and from penalties impacting their professional licenses, credentials, and certifications, for failing to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect, as well as the reporter's supervisor, employer, superior, or principal, as specified. The bill would repeal its provisions on January 1, 2030.

This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.","2025-02-20 >> Read first time.

Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district, when adopting instructional materials for use in school, to include relevant technology-based materials, defined for these purposes to mean basic or supplemental instructional materials that are designed for use by pupils and teachers as learning resources and that require the availability of electronic equipment in order to be used as a learning resource, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the governing board or body of each school district, county office of education, and charter school to provide for substantial teacher involvement in the evaluation and selection of educational technology, as defined, that is required to be used by all teachers or all paraprofessionals of the local educational agency, and to promote the involvement of parents and other members of the community in the evaluation and selection process. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or before January 1, 2027, to develop, and post on the State Department of Education's internet website, best practices and resources to guide school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and joint powers authorities providing educational services in the evaluation and selection of educational technology that is required to be used by all teachers or all paraprofessionals, as specified. The bill would, commencing January 1, 2027, encourage school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to follow those best practices for the evaluation and selection of educational technology.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","2025-02-20 >> Read first time.

Existing law defines ALPR information as information or data collected through the use of an ALPR system.\n\nThis bill would provide that ""public agency"" does not include a transportation agency, a public transit operator, or a local department of transportation or public works department, as specified. The bill would, beginning January 1, 2026, require new, updated, expansions of, or addendums of contractual agreements with ALPR vendors, manufacturers, or suppliers to mandate that no default access is provided to any national ALPR database and that an agency's collected scans are by default not accessible to any other agency, and would impose new requirements on sharing between California state law enforcement agencies. The bill would authorize a law enforcement agency to use ALPR information only for purposes of locating vehicles or persons when either are reasonably suspected of being involved in the commission of a public offense. The bill would prohibit a public agency from retaining ALPR information for more than 60 days after the date of collection if it does not match information on an authorized hot list, as defined, and as of January 1, 2026, would require a public agency to delete all ALPR information that has been held for more than 60 days and does not match information on an authorized hot list within 14 days. By imposing new requirements on public agencies, which include local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law defines an ALPR operator as a person that operates an ALPR system, which does not include a transportation agency. Existing law defines an ALPR end-user a person that accesses or uses an ALPR system, which does not include, among other things, a transportation agency.\n\nThis bill would additionally exclude from the definitions of ""ALPR operator"" and ""ALPR end-user"" a public transit operator, a local department of transportation or public works department, or an airport or airport operator, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires an ALPR operator and ALPR end-user to maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, including operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect ALPR information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.\n\nThis bill would require those security procedures and practices to include safeguards for managing which employees can see the data from their systems, as specified, and requiring data security training and data privacy training for all employees that access ALPR information.\n\nExisting law requires an ALPR operator and ALPR end-user to implement a usage and privacy policy that includes, among other things, a description of the job title or other designation of the employees and independent contractors who are authorized to access and use ALPR information.\n\nThis bill would require the usage and privacy policy to identify what purpose employees and independent contractors access and use ALPR information for. The bill would also require the Department of Justice to, contingent upon an appropriation of sufficient funds, conduct annual random audits on a public agency that is an ALPR operator or ALPR end-user to determine whether they have implemented and are adhering to that usage and privacy policy.\n\nExisting law requires an ALPR operator that accesses or provides access to ALPR information to require that ALPR information only be used for the authorized purposes described in the usage and privacy policy and to maintain a record of that access that includes, among other things, the purpose for accessing the information.\n\nThis bill would instead require that record of access maintained by the ALPR operator to include the case file number or task force name, as applicable, that justifies the search query, and would provide that no queries shall be allowed without a log entry with a valid and current case file number or task force name from the agency conducting the query. \n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","2025-02-04 >> Introduced.

The bill would require the employer to maintain an updated list of all ADS currently in use. The bill would require an employer to notify, as provided, a job applicant that the employer utilizes an ADS when making hiring decisions, if the employer will use the ADS in making decisions for that position. The bill would prohibit an employer from using an ADS that does certain functions and would limit the purposes and manner in which an ADS may be used to make decisions. The bill would authorize a worker to request, and require an employer to provide, a copy of the most recent 12 months of the worker's own data primarily used by an ADS to make a discipline, termination, or deactivation decision, as specified.

Existing law, the Early Learning Personal Information Protection Act (ELPIPA) , generally protects the personal information of a child enrolled in a preschool or prekindergarten course of instruction, defined as a ""pupil,"" by prescribing requirements and prohibitions applicable to an operator of an internet website, online service, online application, or mobile application with actual knowledge that the site, service, or application is used primarily for preschool or prekindergarten purposes and was designed and marketed for preschool and prekindergarten purposes.

This bill would instead apply the provisions of KOPIPA and ELPIPA to an operator of an internet website, online service, online application, or mobile application with actual knowledge that the site, service, or application is used for the applicable school purposes and was designed or marketed for those purposes, as specified. The bill would, among other changes to KOPIPA and ELPIPA related to protecting the personal information of students, prohibit an operator from using information, including persistent unique identifiers, created or gathered by the operator's site, service, or application to train a generative artificial intelligence system or service or develop an artificial intelligence system unless it is in the furtherance of the relevant type of school purpose and for the use and benefit of the school.

This bill would also enact the Higher Education Student Information Protection Act (HESIPA) , which would generally protect the personal information of a student enrolled in a higher education institution, as defined, in a similar manner as KOPIPA and ELPIPA. The bill would make HESIPA operative on July 1, 2026.

This bill would authorize a pupil or student actually harmed by the noncompliance with KOPIPA, ELPIPA, or HESIPA to bring a civil action against the noncompliant operator, as prescribed.","2025-02-20 >> Read first time.

Existing law defines a ""bot"" as an automated online account where all or substantially all of the actions or posts of that account are not the result of a person.\n\nThis bill would require a person who uses a bot to autonomously communicate with another to ensure that the bot discloses to any person with whom the bot communicates when the bot first communicates with the person that the bot is a bot and not a human being, answers truthfully any query from a person regarding its identity as a bot or a human, and refrains from attempting to mislead a person regarding its identity as a bot. The bill would redefine ""bot"" to mean an automated online account or application that a reasonable person could believe is a human being and with respect to which substantially all of the actions or posts of that account or application are the outputs of generative artificial intelligence, as defined. The bill would exempt from its provisions a person who uses a bot that is required to comply with a more prescriptive disclosure scheme.\n\nThis bill would authorize the Attorney General, a district attorney, a county counsel, a city attorney, or a city prosecutor to bring a civil action to punish noncompliance, as prescribed.","2025-02-04 >> Read first time.

Chapter 405, Statutes of 2025.",2025-02-03,2025-2026,Tom Umberg,Diane Dixon,Senate,https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB253,"Existing law, the State Bar Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of attorneys by the State Bar of California, a public corporation governed by a board of trustees. Existing law authorizes the State Bar to establish an examining committee, also known as the Committee of Bar Examiners, with powers that include examining all applicants for admission to practice law. Existing law, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, generally requires all meetings of a state body to be open and public. The State Bar Act makes the State Bar subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, with specified exceptions. The Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act authorizes a state body that is an advisory board, advisory commission, advisory committee, advisory subcommittee, or similar multimember advisory body to hold an open meeting by teleconference if certain requirements are satisfied.\n\nThis bill would specify that the Committee of Bar Examiners shall not be considered an advisory board, advisory commission, advisory committee, advisory subcommittee, or similar multimember advisory body for purposes of those provisions.\n\nExisting law prohibits the Committee of Bar Examiners from altering the bar examination in a manner that requires the substantial modification of the training or preparation required for passage of the examination, except after giving 2 years' notice of that change, and requires the committee to communicate and cooperate with the Law School Council.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the Committee of Bar Examiners from changing the vendor or creator of the multiple choice questions except after giving 18 months' notice, except as specified, and would prohibit the Committee of Bar Examiners from authorizing a remote administration of the bar examination except after giving 2 years' notice. The bill would require 120 days' notice for specified alterations of the bar examination, including changes to the medium in which testing materials are provided. The bill would require the Committee of Bar Examiners to communicate and cooperate with the Law School Council and their deans, or their designees, of law schools accredited by the American Bar Association or the committee. The bill would require the Committee of Bar Examiners to give notice if artificial intelligence is used in creating questions for or grading the bar examination. The bill would authorize the use of scaling on the bar examination, as specified.\n\nExisting law, until January 1, 2026, requires the board of trustees of the State Bar to fix the annual license fee for active licensees for 2025 at a sum not exceeding $400, and, for the annual license fee for inactive licensees for 2025, a sum not exceeding $100.\n\nThis bill, until January 1, 2027, would require the board to fix the annual license fee for active licensees for 2026 at a sum not exceeding $400, and the annual license fee for inactive licensees at a sum not exceeding $100.\n\nExisting law requires certain revenue received from specified noninsurance and insurance affinity programs offered to licensees of the State Bar to go to the California Lawyers Association or an affiliated 501(c) (3) organization to support their respective diversity, equity and inclusion, access to justice, and civil engagement efforts. Existing law prohibits the California Lawyers Association from creating, operating, participating in, or soliciting its members for any affinity or royalty program involving similar insurance or noninsurance products or services with a percentage or share of costs being distributed to the California Lawyers Association.\n\nThis bill would require the California Lawyers Association or the affiliated 501(c) (3) organization to submit an annual report to the Legislature detailing their use of funds and a statement of compliance with the prohibition on creating, operating, or soliciting members for affinity or royalty programs involving similar products or services.\n\nExisting law prohibits a person who is not an attorney to literally translate from English into another language any words or titles that imply that the person is an attorney, and subjects the person to, among other things, a civil penalty payable to the State Bar. Existing law requires the State Bar to annually report the collection and expenditure of those funds for the preceding calendar year to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Judiciary.\n\nThis bill would instead require the State Bar to annually report the collection and expenditure of those funds for the preceding fiscal year.\n\nExisting law requires the State Bar to create a program to certify alternative resolution firms, providers, or practitioners. Existing law requires the program to include different levels or tiers of certification of alternative dispute resolution firms, providers, or practitioners. Existing law requires the higher levels or tiers to be awarded to firms, providers, or practitioners that demonstrate a higher level of commitment to accountability and consumer protection based on criteria developed by the State Bar, and requires the levels or tiers to reference only specified standards of conduct.\n\nThis bill would instead require higher levels or tiers to be awarded to firms, providers, or practitioners that demonstrate a high level of commitment to accountability and consumer protection based on criteria or other standards, including additional education or training, adopted by the State Bar, and would delete the provision requiring the levels or tiers to reference only specified standards of conduct.\n\nThis bill would also delete obsolete provisions, update cross-references, and make other technical changes in various provisions of the act, including deleting a provision prohibiting inactive licensees from voting or holding office on the board.","2025-02-03 >> Introduced.
